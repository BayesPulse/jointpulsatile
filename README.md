This directory is initially a clone of the code made available with the paper in jointpulsatile_paper repo.  I will be using this directory to divide up the code into more workable chunks so we can merge it with other code development happening with the population model.

the JointModelCode_Liupaper is the orginal cloned code.  JointModelCode_restructured is the newly subsetted code.  The _Liupaper folder will be deleted after the code is deconstructed into its modular forms.

Then we will adapt the population parts of the code to the new popmodel code Matt is creating and recode the joint model loops in the same reproducible framework.
